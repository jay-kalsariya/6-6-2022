  <p  style="background-color: burlywood;"> Have a discussion about the new service with the service catalog manager to discuss the placement in the catalog (service taxonomy) so it makes sense from the clients perspective and adheres to the general principles already established for the service catalog.   The service catalog manager is Adriene Radcliffe(likely to be transitioned to Connie Wilson). The catalog is governed by the SOM IT Leadership team.
    Begin by filling out the Service Introduction checklist, which is a MS Word document you can find here.   The service introduction checklist allows you to draft the necessary information needed to create a service offering page in the service catalog, ensures you have thought about service ownership, documentation, knowledge articles, and escalation path for support.  You can also list the proposed go-live date.
    Once you have the Service Introduction form filled out, have the Service Catalog manager review it, and the checklist will be scheduled for approval with the SOM IT Leadership at their next meeting.  Service Catalog is a standing item on their agenda in the event changes or new items come up for review. 
    Following the SOM IT Leadership meeting, the Service Catalog Manager will inform you of the disposition of the approval along with any requested changes of escalation path, ownership, or communication plans.  When the new service offering is approved, you can create the new service offering object in Insight. 
    Now you can create the Service Offering page by going to the service group page the offering will be part of and select Create ...  and then select the SC Individual Service Offering template. The information in this template will come from the Service Introduction checklist you created and had approved.   When you first create the service offering page, you should restrict it to SOM Information Technology only until it is ready for go-live
    Continue to build out the service offering, and as you do, create knowledge pages under your Service Offering page for important service related help such as how to request access, how to sign up, how to login, how to use, and other key service help guides.  Create these knowledge articles by navigating to the service offering page, then select Create... and select How-to article.  By using this technique, the knowledge articles will be ready for the support team when you prepare to launch the service.  In addition, if the service offering draft you created is restricted, all the children pages such as knowledge articles will be restricted.
    As you approach the go-live date, ensure you set-up a meeting with Client Services, or Media Services for a Service Transition Meeting -  These are the tier 1 teams in SOM IT that will answer and triage initial inquiries about the service, before escalating a ticket to the service owner.  Review the Service Introduction checklist with them, and review the knowledge articles you created and provide context about them.  Also let them know about your communication plan, as they may get inquiries prior to the launch if it is available as a news item through digital signage or on the SOM Event calendar.
    When you launch the service or just prior to launching the service, do final edits of the Service Offering page, and remove the "SOM Information Technology only" restriction on the service offering page.  This will make the service offering visible as well as the knowledge articles you created
    Go to the Service (service group page) where the offering should be listed with all the other offerings for that service in the catalog and add it with a brief description.
    Notify the SOM IT team that the new service is live, along with the service pages. </p>
