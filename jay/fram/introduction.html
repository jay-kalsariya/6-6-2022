   <p style ="background-color: cornflowerblue;"> A solution is another name for a homogeneous mixture.
     A mixture as a material composed of two or more substances.
      In a solution, the combination is so intimate that the different substances cannot be differentiated by sight, even with a microscope.
       Compare, for example, a mixture of salt and pepper and another mixture consisting of salt and water. 
       In the first mixture, we can readily see individual grains of salt and the flecks of pepper. 
       A mixture of salt and pepper is not a solution.
        However, in the second mixture, no matter how carefully we look, 
        we cannot see two different substances. Salt dissolved in water is a solution.</p>

    <p style="background-color:chocolate" > major component of a solution, called the solvent, is typically the same phase as the solution itself. 
    Each minor component of a solution (and there may be more than one) is called the solute.
     In most of the solutions we will describe in this textbook, there will be no ambiguity about whether a component is the solvent or the solute. 
     For example, in a solution of salt in water, the solute is salt, and solvent is water.
     Solutions come in all phases, and the solvent and the solute do not have to be in the same phase to form a solution (such as salt and water). For example, air is a gaseous soluti
     on of about 80% nitrogen and about 20% oxygen, with some other gases present in much smaller amounts. An alloy is a solid solution consisting of a metal (like iron) with some other metals or nonmetals dissolved in it. Steel, an alloy of iron and carbon and small amounts of other metals, is an example of a solid solution. Table  11.1.1  lists some common types of solutions, with examples of each. </p>
